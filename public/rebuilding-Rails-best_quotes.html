<h1 id="best-quotes">Best Quotes</h1>
<p>This is the &quot;Best Quotes&quot; example application from the book &quot;Rebuilding Rails&quot; by Noah Gibbs. You can find the canonical branch of this framework at &quot;http://github.com/noahgibbs/best_quotes&quot;.</p>
<p>It really only exists to give Rulers something to serve up.</p>
<p>The code is still free to use if you want to. I just don't know why you'd want to.</p>
