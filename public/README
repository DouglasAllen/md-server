In February 2001, Addison Wesley Longman, the publishers and copyright 
holders of the book, graciously agreed to release the book under an
Open Publication license.

I have converted the book from it's original LaTeX into XML, and then 
into HTML. The XML and HTML files live in their own subdirectories 
below this one. The HTML files are self-contained: you can point a
browser at a local copy and read away.

Our hope is that people will start using the XML files to
'Ruby-enable' various environments, such as IDEs and editors, as well
as repacking the information in different ways. It would be nice if
you could drop us an e-mail telling us how you're using the material
so we can start compiling a list.

This release contains some known formatting problems, but I wanted
to get in out in front of folks for comment.

1. Diagrams have not been converted.
2. Some code fragments appear in body font, not code font.
3. Some lists have strange formatting under Mozilla 0.8. This formatting
   is OK under Netscape and IE, so I'm open to suggestions on what
   is happening
