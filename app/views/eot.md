## Welcome

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is my Heroku Equation of Time application.  This is a Ruby Rack application 
using Sinatra, Haml, markdown, and of course the Ruby gem "equationoftime".  
Without too much detail I will only attempt to describe how this Ruby gem works from
the tutorial link above. You may also read the source code for it at github.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In case you would like to know where I got the graphic image from I renered it 
using the same code that is R code on the image page from wikipedia equation of time.

Please note that some of the pages here have not been rewitten yet and may not render as expected.
This site is still a WIP (Work In Progress). But please keep coming back and check us out.

Enjoy! :-D
