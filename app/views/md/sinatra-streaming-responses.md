### Streaming Responses

Sometimes you want to start sending out data while still generating parts of
the response body. In extreme examples, you want to keep sending data until
the client closes the connection. You can use the `stream` helper to avoid
creating your own wrapper:

``` ruby
get '/' do
  stream do |out|
    out << "It's gonna be legen -\n"
    sleep 0.5
    out << " (wait for it) \n"
    sleep 1
    out << "- dary!\n"
  end
end
```

This allows you to implement streaming APIs,
[Server Sent Events](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/), and can be used as
the basis for [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). It can also be
used to increase throughput if some but not all content depends on a slow
resource.

Note that the streaming behavior, especially the number of concurrent requests,
highly depends on the web server used to serve the application. Some servers,
like WEBRick, might not even support streaming at all. If the server does not
support streaming, the body will be sent all at once after the block passed to
`stream` finishes executing. Streaming does not work at all with Shotgun.

If the optional parameter is set to `keep_open`, it will not call `close` on
the stream object, allowing you to close it at any later point in the
execution flow. This only works on evented servers, like Thin and Rainbows.
Other servers will still close the stream:

``` ruby
# long polling

set :server, :thin
connections = []

get '/subscribe' do
  # register a client's interest in server events
  stream(:keep_open) do |out|
    connections << out
    # purge dead connections
    connections.reject!(&:closed?)
  end
end

post '/:message' do
  connections.each do |out|
    # notify client that a new message has arrived
    out << params['message'] << "\n"

    #Â indicate client to connect again
    out.close
  end

  # acknowledge
  "message received"
end
```

### Logging

In the request scope, the `logger` helper exposes a `Logger` instance:

``` ruby
get '/' do
  logger.info "loading data"
  # ...
end
```

This logger will automatically take your Rack handler's logging settings into
account. If logging is disabled, this method will return a dummy object, so
you do not have to worry about it in your routes and filters.

Note that logging is only enabled for `Sinatra::Application` by default, so if
you inherit from `Sinatra::Base`, you probably want to enable it yourself:

``` ruby
class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  configure :production, :development do
    enable :logging
  end
end
```

To avoid any logging middleware to be set up, set the `logging` setting to
`nil`. However, keep in mind that `logger` will in that case return `nil`. A
common use case is when you want to set your own logger. Sinatra will use
whatever it will find in `env['rack.logger']`.
