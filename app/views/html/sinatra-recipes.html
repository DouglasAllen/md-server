<p>Community contributed recipes and techniques for the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra Web Framework</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-yet-another-doc-project">Why yet another doc project?</h2>
<p>Quite simply, the Sinatra README and Book have become long in the tooth.</p>
<p>This project is to extract any redundant and overlap between the two sources, and create a home for user contributed recipes and documentation to take form.</p>

<h2 id="heres-the-run-down">Here's the run down</h2>
<p>To get started you should clone the repository from github:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">git</span> clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes.git</code></pre></div>
<p>Now once you <code>cd</code> into <code>sinatra-recipes</code> you should see a few things.</p>
<p>First you should take note of the application files:</p>
<pre><code>app.rb # a tiny application for displaying the contributed recipes

config.ru # rackup file for deploying to heroku

Gemfile # dependencies file for bundler to run the app</code></pre>
<p>If you want to run the application yourself first you need the <code>bundler</code> gem.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">gem</span> install bundler</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are on Rubinius make sure that you have the latest bundler version installed. Versions prior to 1.0.10 won't work.</p>
<pre><code># then install the application dependencies</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">bundle</span> install</code></pre></div>
<p>Once that is complete, you should only need to run <code>rackup</code> in the application root and visit: <a href="http://localhost:9292">localhost:9292</a></p>
<p>Since the application just maps the flat files, you can browse either the source or the web app to view recipes.</p>
<p>If you check out the source you will see a few folders listed, in each folder there is a <code>README.md</code> that will briefly explain the topic. This can also be view by going to <code>/p/:topic</code> where <code>topic</code> is the folder you wish to view.</p>
<p>In each folder there should be a number of recipes pertaining to each topic.</p>
<h2 id="on-translations">On translations</h2>
<p>Currently we're not supporting translations in the main repository.</p>
<p>However, if you'd like to maintain a fork for translating the docs then feel free to do so, and add your fork to the <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/wiki/Translations">list of translations in the wiki</a>.</p>
