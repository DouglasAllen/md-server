<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>    This is my Heroku Equation of Time application. This is a Ruby Rack application using Sinatra, Haml, markdown, and of course the Ruby gem &quot;equationoftime&quot;.<br />
Without too much detail I will only attempt to describe how this Ruby gem works from the tutorial link above. You may also read the source code for it at github.</p>
<p>    In case you would like to know where I got the graphic image from I renered it using the same code that is R code on the image page from wikipedia equation of time.</p>
<p>Please note that some of the pages here have not been rewitten yet and may not render as expected. This site is still a WIP (Work In Progress). But please keep coming back and check us out.</p>
<p>Enjoy! :-D</p>
